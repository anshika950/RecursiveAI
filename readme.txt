RecursiveAI - Video Demo Script
============================
Goal: ~2 minute walkthrough

0. BEFORE RECORDING
--------------------
- Start the server:
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

- Confirm models are ready:
  curl -s http://localhost:11434/api/tags | jq '.models[].name'
  (should show "mistral" and "orca-mini")

- Open http://localhost:8000/static/demo.html


1. INTRO (10-15 sec)
---------------------
"This is RecursiveAI - a containerized FastAPI microservice that runs
open-source AI models like Mistral and Orca Mini locally through Ollama.
Every request is protected by JWT authentication, and all data is
validated with Pydantic v2."

Briefly show the Architecture tab.


2. REGISTER TAB (15 sec)
-------------------------
Fill in username / email / password, click Register.

"I'll create an account - the password is hashed with Argon2 before
it's stored, never saved in plain text."


3. LOGIN TAB (15 sec)
----------------------
Login with the same credentials.

"Logging in returns a JWT access token - this is what authorizes every
protected API call from here on. You can see it right in the response."


4. AI MODEL TAB (40-50 sec) - the core demo
--------------------------------------------
Select Provider: Ollama -> Model: Orca Mini (or Mistral) -> type a
prompt like "What is machine learning?" -> click Generate Text.

"I'll send an authenticated request to generate text. The request body
is validated with a Pydantic v2 schema - if I'm not logged in or the
token's invalid, this gets rejected with a 401."

Show the real generated output. Click Check Status.

"This confirms the model is running locally - no external API calls,
fully open-source."


5. API FLOW TAB (15 sec)
-------------------------
"This tab visualizes the full request lifecycle - register, login,
receive token, attach token to every request, get a validated JSON
response back."


6. ENDPOINTS / RAW REQUESTS TABS (15 sec)
------------------------------------------
"Every endpoint and its raw request/response shape is documented here -
this isn't just a UI demo, it's the actual API contract."

(Optional: show /docs Swagger UI too.)


7. WRAP-UP (10 sec)
--------------------
"RecursiveAI is a JWT-secured, Pydantic-validated FastAPI microservice
serving open models locally via Ollama, fully containerized with
Docker. Code is on GitHub."

Show: github.com/anshika950/assignment-2


BACKUP COMMANDS IF UI HAS ISSUES
---------------------------------
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"demo_user","password":"DemoPass123"}' | jq .

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/model/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"What is machine learning?","max_tokens":100,"temperature":0.7,"provider":"ollama","model":"orca-mini"}' | jq .
